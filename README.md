‚úÖ **Recommendations**
Looking at the dashboard, a few things stand out. First, there‚Äôs a slight gender gap ‚Äî more male employees than female ‚Äî so it would be great to focus on hiring more women, especially in IT and Finance roles. The HR department also seems small with just 2 people; adding more HR support can really help manage the growing team. Most employees are based in Lahore and Karachi, which is fine, but exploring other cities like Islamabad could help the company grow its reach and tap into new talent. The team is mostly young (25‚Äì35 years old), which brings energy, but hiring a few experienced professionals could add maturity and strategic direction. Also, there are a few contractual and part-time workers ‚Äî if they‚Äôre doing well, maybe offer them full-time roles for better stability. Lastly, the salary ranges look okay overall, but it‚Äôs worth checking if everyone‚Äôs being paid fairly for their role and experience.
